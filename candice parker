Yuppp there is a rap in here, shit I don't just write code 0.0


like the spark candice park 
moving hart in the yard
shoot my shot like I'm harden
move it back bitch im startin

young adult grindin startvin
high up here like a martian
what's your name escuse me pardon
yeah your legs i'm tryin part 'em
yeah
 you havent heard of me
i'm pretty new on the scene
partial chocolate and some cream
that's the make up of this G.

loaded up on the sauce
always knew i'd be popin off
dummy smelly on the cough
drawing lines with the chalk
dunkin on them like im parker
double takes from the starters
passive glances from the haters
gloss them over cause i'm faded
